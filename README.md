magicCube
=========

Classic Magic cube - built in html5/css3/javascript

This is the classic magic cube.

It runs straight in your browser i.e. I did not use .less for this - tear... ;(

v 0.1 only runs in Chrome

Reason:

- Opera currently does not support 3D transformation
- IE 10+ "supports" 3D transformation but fails on some mouse over functions, will create a wrapper in the future
- Firefox/Safari - Only a few functionality issues that is ccurently preventing this from working

Controls:

- Hold left mouse button and move

x-axis rotation

- q : left up
- r : right up 
- a : left down  
- f: right down

y-axis rotation

- e : top anti-cw  
- c : bot anti-cw

z-axis rotation

- 2 : back cw
